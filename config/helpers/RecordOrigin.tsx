            The over 10 thousand hours of recordings give an
            unparalleled insight into the politics and the fight for human
            rights in the Soviet Union; into everyday life of the Russian-speakers
            living in the USSR or abroad, in a diaspora; into the Russian literature,
            though unpublished, suppressed and unwanted, yet making its way to the
            grateful readers; into the differences and disputes between the
            three waves of Russian emigration with their uneasy relationships
            in the West; into Russian culture in exile, which would soon make
            its way back to the motherland.

            The original open-reel tapes containing Radio Liberty’s
            live broadcasts of the ‘Munich period’ (1953-1995) were preserved,
            archived, digitized and systematized by the Russian Service’s
            staff in Prague in the late 1990’s. RFE/RL donated both the tapes
            and the digitized copies to Hoover Institution Archives,
            Stanford University. In 2015 Hoover Institute authorized OSA to
            create metadata for the digitized audio, process the collection
            and prepare the archive for publication online.The collection
            contains 26147 unique audio files that were produced and broadcast
            by RFE/RL’s Russian Service. Spanning from the very first program
